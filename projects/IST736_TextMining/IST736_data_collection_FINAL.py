########There are some manual updates I would like to do...

###Giannis Antetokounmpo is one of the best players in the league but he was drafted 15th overall, not even top ten. His web page used a different last name so his info didn't work. Manually updating that info:
#Giannis page: https://www.nbadraft.net/players/giannis-adetokoubo/
draft_post2000.loc[610,'PLAYER_NAME'] #confirm its the correct row
draft_post2000.loc[610,'Overall']=92
draft_post2000.loc[610,'NBA Comparison']='Nicolas Batum'
draft_post2000.loc[610,'Strengths']='Athletic wing with a remarkable 7’3” wingspan of and incredibly huge hands … He’s still in the development stage and has grown three inches since last year … Standing 6’9”, he has amazing mobility and body control for a guy his height … He’s able to change directions off the dribble and with the ball in his hands with incredible smoothness and quickness, getting to the rim while maintaining excellent balance … His athleticism and wingspan make him able to cover 4 positions on the floor, showing great versatility … He has a natural feel for the game and a good basketball IQ, with good passing skills and instincts and the potential to become a point forward at the next level … Thanks to his big hands and his creativity, he’s an amazing ball handler for his position … He’s unstoppable with momentum, especially during secondary transition, when he can exploit his amazing mobility starting from the dribble … This year during youth games and Greek second division games, he showed the ability to start from one end after the rebound and go coast to coast and get to the rim with 2-3 dribbles, with incredible smoothness and speed … He shows good potential to improve as a shooter even if it’s his main shortcoming at the moment … On the defensive end he has great instincts in the passing lanes and in help situations, often with perfect timing for blocks from the blind side … With his physical tools he could easily guard opposing wings, showing the potential to defend both guards and power forwards, depending match ups. He’s still raw in many perspectives, but his ceiling and upside are the highest among the internationals of this 2013 draft …'
draft_post2000.loc[610,'Weaknesses']='His level of competition is a big concern, because it makes judging his talent and current level very difficult. Without question he has a large basement to go with his large ceiling … Despite his athletic abilities he lacks elite explosiveness … He has to bulk up, working especially in the lower body since he’s definitely too skinny to face NBA opponents at the moment … The concern is how to develop him correctly from the muscular standpoint, in order to avoid loss of speed and mobility (Boris Diaw) … His game off the ball is rather weak, especially related to spacing and use of screens and cuts, in fact most of his offensive production happens with the ball in his hands … The only exception is when he’s slashing to the basket for put backs or on the break … Plus he basically has no mid-range game, he tends to attack the rim without considering the option of the pull up jumper … He shot 31.3 % from three point line this year, showing good potential, but he lacks consistency at this point, his mechanics seems unnatural and not fluent … On the defensive side, he needs to learn the basis, since he’s beaten by the opponents due a lack of proper positioning and comprehension … The overall impression is of a raw prospect from basketball comprehension standpoint, whose is based on instincts, talent, physical gifts and natural feel for the game. For this reason he needs to be tested at a higher level of competition than Greek second division, since his level of experience is definitely low.'
draft_post2000.loc[610,'Notes']='Also known as: Giannis Antetokounmpo … The youngest player in this year’s NBA draft. Won’t be 19 until December … Son of Nigerian immigrants, he was enrolled with his older brother (20 years old) Athanasios Adetokoubo by Filiathlitikos Academy, an ambitious club from Athens Area. He averaged 8 points and 5 rebounds in Greek A2 this year, when he came out as he came out of obscurity to become a potential lottery pick … This June he could be part of the 2013 adidas Eurocamp, since he has just gotten his Nigerian passport.'

draft_post2000.loc[236,'Weaknesses']='Playing style and weight puts a lot of pressure on his legs and feet. The question begs to be asked whether he can stay on the floor for a lengthy NBA career … He will likely need to drop another 15-20 lbs in order to sustain his playing style … 250-260 lbs would be ideal.

###Ideally, any player we use should have both a strength and a weakness for better analysis. Taking a look at how many players have one but not the other to see if it is reasonable to manually update them.

draft_post2000.loc[220,'Weaknesses']='He is an average athlete, which may prove to be problematic when competing against stronger, faster wings … Underwhelming speed and athleticism … Somewhat between positions as a 3/4 without a great ability to defend either position … Tends to hoist up questionable shots … Often forces the action with the shot clock winding down, tossing up a difficult 3-pointer … For the amount of 3-point attempts he takes per game (6.1), he could improve some in that area, shooting 37.4% from beyond the arc as a sophomore … Needs to bulk up his thin frame or else he may get pushed around by more physical players at the next level … Not particularly quick laterally, and lack of a quick first step could limit his offensive effectiveness … 1.3 assists to 2.4 turnovers shows that he needs to get better at protecting the ball. Though being such a focal point of Louisville’s undermanned offense surely played into those numbers …'
draft_post2000.loc[272,'Weaknesses']='Below average athlete by NBA standards … Upper body needs to fill up … Doesn’t really have bounce, which can be a problem at the next level … Quick, but not an explosive player, with an average first step … Short wingspan (measured at about 6-8, same as his height), which limits him on defense … Ball handling is kind of loose, he doesn’t always dribble with his head up, which leads to turnovers … He can’t always create separation from his defender due to his average athleticism and ball handling … Mid-range game isn’t completely there yet … He can be too passive at times, just standing in a corner waiting for the ball to come to him … Not really effective when his shot isn’t falling, at least just yet … He can’t really mix it up on offense … He doesn’t draw fouls due to his playing style because he isn’t attacking the paint, so he doesn’t really go the line a lot, which is bad because he is a very good free throw shooter … He can suffer from tunnel vision at times while driving to the basket … He occasionally tries difficult passes that just aren’t there … Stronger opponents bully him on the defensive boards … Because he mostly stands in the perimeter, he is not a threat on the offensive board … His post up game is minimal, he isn’t really taking advantage of his size and he can’t exploit mismatches … Has an average lateral quickness … Gambles and goes for the steal, putting pressure on team’s defense … Spaces out on Defense, watching the ball and stays in no man’s land, losing his player … His post up defense is problematic, mainly because he is not strong enough to contain bulkier opponents …'
draft_post2000.loc[276,'Weaknesses']='At 6’7’’, he will struggle to guard and rebound against taller players in the post, doesn’t have a real defined position  … Older player (5th year senior who will turn 23 in November) without a ton of upside, having just finished his senior season at Villanova … Struggled in the role of go to scorer in senior year … Hasn’t shown much fluidity/athleticism on offense (possibly a product of the Villanova offense) … Lacks an explosive first step off the dribble and the speed of elite NBA forwards … Not a great spot up shooter … Can be over-aggressive defensively, resulting in unwanted fouls … He must learn to move his feet better instead of relying on his upper body for defense … Got used to handling the ball, but doesn;t seem have the ball skills to handle at the NBA level … Average at best rebounder in college despite his size … Has not shown much in terms of post offense … Has not had to guard down in the post much at Villanova …'
draft_post2000.loc[282,'Weaknesses']='The biggest question will be on the defensive end as he lacks ideal length and in particular foot speed … At 6’7 and not that much bigger of a wingspan (6’8) he won’t possess the quickness and length to stay in front of and check NBA small forwards, nor the length or physicality to match the power forwards… 8’5 standing reach is good for a shooting guard, but small at the 3 position … His toughness will help him initially but over time he will have to figure out how to overcome his defensive deficiencies… Offensively, to become elite he’ll have to improve his vision and playmaking skills for his teammates, otherwise he’ll put himself in a situation where he may be valued only as a spot-up shooter … A good but not great shooter, but could improve as time goes on considering his level of dedication … Shot 77% from the free throw line, which is solid but if shooting is his forte, he’ll need to raise that …'
draft_post2000.loc[300,'Weaknesses']='Young does not have ideal size at 6-2 or length with just a 6-2 wingspan for an NBA guard … These physical limitations can become apparent once he gets all the way to the rim … He lacks the length and vertical explosiveness to finish through NBA length and athleticism and does not project as an efficient scorer at the basket in the NBA … He will have to rely much more on craft to be successful inside at the next level … He has been a bit turnover prone at times this season due to his tendency to make some risky passes at times … However, much of that is due to his unusually high usage rate, and he still has an assist to turnover ratio of better than two to one … Young’s shot selection at times leaves a lot to be desired … As good of a shooter as he is, there are times where he will hoist a very long jumper early in the shot clock without moving the ball and looking for a better opportunity first … As polished as Young is offensively, he is a near liability on defense … He rarely gets into a stance on this end of the floor and shows poor effort guarding the ball … Opposing guards are easily able to get into the lane against him and he is often caught ball-watching when his man does not have the ball … Due to his lack of ideal size and athleticism, he will be a guy for opposing offenses to attack … He is not explosive enough to stay in front of quick guards, and he is also not big enough to stop anyone else on the court … The effort has to improve first and foremost, but even if it does he may never be a reliable defensive player unless he can create a high number of steals … Will need to add strengh to be able to better finish off drives and also defend … Undersized as a scorer at 6’2 with a 6’2 wingspan … Lack of size and physicality will make defense a challenge at the next level … Has a way to go to become a true point guard … Has questionable shot selection and can be too quick with the trigger at times … Sometimes brings the ball up the court and shoots it early in the clock before without anyone else getting a touch or making the defense work … His release is low, starting from his chest … Doesn’t always keep it simple. Tries to do too much at times … Can be turnover prone … Not an elite athlete. Lacks explosiveness. Plays below the rim … May struggle defensively moving forward due to his lack of strength and playing through physicality … Is bothered by length when driving … Gets a number of shots blocked and passes deflected … One of the best at this stage …'
draft_post2000.loc[300,'Notes']='Attended Norman High School in his hometown of Norman, Oklahoma…2015-2016 Oklahoma Gatorade Player of the Year and Oklahoma Class 6A Champion…Consensus five-star recruit…McDonald’s All-American and Jordan Brand Classic Selection … Measured at 6’0, 158 lbs, with a 6’1 wingspan at the 2014 Nike Elite 100 … Measured 6’1.5’’ in shoes, with a 6’2’’ wingspan and 162 lbs at the 2015 Nike Basketball Academy … Averaged 21.3 points per game over the Nike EYBL … On December 19th, 2019 tied the all time NCAA Division I assists record with 22 against Northwestern State …'
draft_post2000.loc[300,'Outlook']='2016 Peach Jam Co-MVP … Young had a strong Nike EYBL season and is one of the top guards in the 2017 high school class.'
draft_post2000.loc[324,'Weaknesses']='Playing with passion isn’t always a good thing, since he occasionally gets caried away by his emotions … He has an incosistent motor, with a lot of ups and downs even in the same game … He is a better athlete than most think, but he is still just an average athlete by NBA standards … He must bulk up considerably … Has a peculiar body structure with a slight hunch back with small chest and waist, so it’s not certain how he can really bulk ip … Lacks elite explosiveness … He doesn’t really have bounce off one foot when driving to the basket … He has a short wingspan (measured at 6-9) … He is mostly a streaky shooter for now.. He needs to improve in Catch and Shot and Spot  Up situations… His off the ball game needs work… He must learn to be effective when he doesn’t have the ball in his hands… Has problems against athletic wings on both ends of the floor… Can’t really finish through contact because his upper body isn’t strong enough… Has problems finishing against length because of his athletic limitations… He really likes going to his left and has problems when he is forced driving to his right… His mid-range game still needs improvement.. Should add some Post moves to his arsenal to explore miss-matches… Must learn to let game come to him when his shot isn’t falling and not force things…. He could improve his on the move passes… Can be turnover prone at times… His short wingspan limits him on defense… His lateral quickness is average… He is not always focused on defense, mainly because he is used to be “The Guy”at smaller level and didn’t want to spend energy on that end of the floor… Struggles on defense against explosive wings… His low stance on defense needs work… Needs to improve his off the ball defense… Gambles and goes for the steal, which adds pressure to his team…'
draft_post2000.loc[340,'Weaknesses']='Still a bit raw offensively … Feel for the game … Relies too much on his athletic ability at this point … He’s not a consistent threat as an offensive option from game-to-game … Has potential as a shooter, but needs to improve his shooting consistency from all areas of the court, including free throws … Needs to tweak his shooting mechanics … Low release on his shot … Not a threat to shoot off the dribble … Overall shot selection needs improvement … Needs to play more controlled and less reckless in the half court … Is sometimes prone to overdriving and getting caught in the lane … Has a tendency to throw up wild floaters and shots in and around the lane … Ball handling has room for improvement (needs to be tightened) … He isn’t a natural passer/playmaker … Will need to work on his playmaking ability for his teammates and overall decision-making … Needs to limit turnovers … Tends to have lapses on defense sometimes … Can get lost when playing off-the-ball defense … Doesn’t react well to opponent movement on-the-ball, and gets lost or lazy off-the-ball … Low steal and block rates despite physical tools … Closeouts are iffy at times … Doesn’t consistently stay in front and when he does he lacks the strength in his 195-pound frame to contain dribble penetration … Can create jump shots but struggles to connect with consistency … Needs to improve in all areas as a shooter; free throws, midrange, and three point. Shot 16.7% from three over the Nike EYBL … Still has room to tighten up his ball handling ability … Can be reckless taking the ball to the basket … Relies upon outjumping defenders at the rim … Can improve his post-game when matched up with smaller guards but does show confidence and willingness to take defenders into the post … Although he can find opportunities to find alley-oops and gaps when cutting backdoor, he can improve moving without the ball especially on the perimeter. Relies on his first step to beat his man after he has the ball … Has room to add upper body strength … Shows some playmaking ability but is strictly a scoring guard at this stage, doesn’t have the combo guard skills yet. Finished with 33 assists to 41 turnovers over the Nike EYBL …'
draft_post2000.loc[340,'Outlook']='Diallo may be the top athlete in high school basketball. His ball skills aren’t quite up to par with his natural ability yet but with some work and time, he can develop into a big time player at the highest levels.'
draft_post2000.loc[340,'Notes']='Measued 6’3.75 without shoes, 6’10.5 wingspan, 179 lbs and a 8’4.5 standing reach in the summer of 2015 … Measured 6’4 without shoes, 6’5 with shoes, 199 lbs, with a 6’11 wingspan and 8’5.5 standing reach at the June 2017 USA U19 tryouts'
draft_post2000.loc[409,'Weaknesses']='Likely to be overwhelmed by NBA athletes. A below average athlete by NBA standards … At 6’8, moves like a center in a small forward’s body … Lack of size at the 4 position (6’8) compounds his athleticism concerns … Very slow laterally and slow to react to plays … He lacks the speed to defend SFs and ideal size and strength to defend in the post … Not especially fast in the open floor. A bit of a plodder. Coming off a season ending injury (stress fracture in his foot) puts draft chances in jeopardy … Level of competition was low playing in the Horizon League … Shot well below expectations as a senior at 36.3% 3p, after hitting 44.0% and 46.6% from 3 as a Junior and Sophomore … Drop in efficiency may be partially due to teams game planning to limit his looks from behind the arch …'
draft_post2000.loc[415,'Weaknesses']='Although he is a good athlete, there are times his feet look a little stiff and slow …  He lacks elite explosiveness … He looks like he isn’t always 100% intense and focused, with too much of a laid back attitude … His reactions on both ends of the floor are a little slow, which could hurt him at the next level … He might be projected as a power forward, but he has been used almost exclusively as a center the last couple of years … His offensive game needs polishing, since he remains a little bit raw and depends too much on his physical attributes … Has some problems finishing against length … He is an incosistent shooter from long range … His footwork in the post is mediorce … His back to the basket game needs a lot of work … He can’t really play physical for now on offense, which makes him too predictable … His face up game is just average … He seems to prefer to play facing the basket rather than with his back to it, which can be a problem because he won’t be able to exploit miss-matches … Improving ball handler, but still not good enough for a power forward … Has good passing instincts, but his passes don’t always connect, because he often telegraphs them … It remains a question mark whether he will be able to follow Stretch-4s on the perimeter despite his great lateral quickness … Not always as commited as he should be on defensive rotations … At times he doesn’t have a good low stance on defense, which makes it easy for opponents to get past him … Not as a good rim protector as you would expect for a player with his physical attributes and skillset … Gambles a lot on defense, going for the steal, which adds presure to his team … Post defense is average and can be exploited by experienced and skillfull Bigs … Can get pushed around at times by bigger opponents … Not the most fluid player, legs are a bit stiff … Seems to prefer to drift out on the perimeter instead of using his size and strength around the basket … He improved his shape over this year, but he absolutely needs to work on his consistency and intensity. .. He’s a decent leaper, but lacks explosiveness and the “second jump” on defensive end … He has to improve his positioning, seems to lack game comprehension, probably due to the lack of experience at a high level … Lacks solid post moves, in order to properly utilize his physical and muscular advantage, he prefers to play facing the basket exploiting only his mobility … Overall impression is of a player currently relying on his physical attributes and instincts, raw potential still to be developed and nurtured in the proper environment … He has to show more competitive fire and aggressiveness to improve and compete at a higher level … Very inconsistent … Needs to get in better physical shape and gain stamina … Lacks a high level of experience, still plays in a junior, under-21 league … Doesn’t always play with enough intensity defensively … Not aggressive enough in closing out and pressuring opponent shots … From time to time too relaxed, especially in defense, Doesn’t protect the rim as much as he could … Can be too casual with his passing … Back to the basket game is underdeveloped, needs to focus a lot of attention to this … At times lacks a fundamental defensive stance, straight legs and up right posture … Rebounds the ball solely based on physical attributes, must learn to properly box out …'
draft_post2000.loc[415,'Notes']='He played the 2014-2015 season for Pau-Lacq-Orthez Espoirs (Juniors) team, then he moved this summer to Mega Leks in Adriatic league, thanks to the solid connections of his agent (Pedja Materic) with Misko Raznatovic, agent and owner of Mega … He had 8 points and 6 rebounds this season in ABA league … Former member of U18 and U20 French national teams …'
#draft_post2000.loc[705,'Weaknesses']=Izzet Turkyilmaz has a barebone analysis with no weaknesses
draft_post2000.loc[758,'Weaknesses']='His position will be a question mark in the NBA… Not a great decision maker, he does not play with the poise nor does he have the mentality of a playmaker … He does not make good decisions in traffic, he has a tendency of leaving his feet to make passes and does not usually deliver the ball on target … Has almost a 1/1 assist to turnover ratio for his career, further showing that he is a liability as a primary ballhandler … As an off-guard, he lacks the frame and mass to be able to battle with the bigger and stronger opponents … His biggest deficiency is the continued inconsistency with his jumpshot, which allows defenders to play off of him and take away his penetration … Even with the improvements, he still shoots a different jumper almost every attempt and his elbow tends to go too far to the outside … The release point also varies and he has a bad habit of hanging too long in the air and shooting on the way down (especially off the dribble) …  '
draft_post2000.loc[822,'Weaknesses']='His main strength is also a weakness, as his size and weight are major limiting factors … He is not a great athlete and does not get off the ground well … Settles for too many outside jumpers even though most of the time he has a distinct advantage by attacking inside … He struggles against taller and longer defenders because even though he can body them out of position, he still has a hard time finishing overtop of them … He undoubtedly carries too much weight and it shows in his footspeed and inability to get up and down the floor.  His lateral quickness is very limited and he has trouble defending quicker faceup forwards, or defending against the pick and roll … His motor is also a bit of a question mark at this point, he didn’t play major minutes this season and at times he seemed winded when playing for longer stretches … Battled with inconsistency all season – he was not able to put together a string of good games at any point during his freshman season … Very turnover prone, he struggles making plays in traffic or when the double team comes, he seems to panic and has a tendency to throw ill-advised passes …'
