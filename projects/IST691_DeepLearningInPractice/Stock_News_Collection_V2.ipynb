The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite declined over 0.76% and 1% respectively, reflecting investor concerns over an anticipated economic slowdown.  In the midst of these market fluctuations, tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) fell short of impressing investors, despite exceeding revenue and earnings targets. Meta Platforms, in particular, suffered a 3.7% stock drop after warning of \"volatility\" in the ad market. This news came as a surprise to many investors, given the company's recent surge in quarterly profit. The market also responded poorly to Alphabet and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), amplifying investor unease. Toymakers Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) and Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) saw their shares fall, while drugmaker Merck and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) experienced gains. Commodity prices followed suit with the stock market trend, with West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil both decreasing by 2.3%. Bitcoin also slipped by 1.6%, and the 10-year yield fell by 10.6 basis points. Despite the strong Q3 GDP growth, Wall Street's reaction underscores the complex interplay between economic indicators and investor sentiment.

All three major U.S. stock indexes ended in the red, and all remain on track for weekly declines.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq suffered the biggest percentage drop, weighed down by the \"magnificent seven\" group of megacap stocks in the face of cloudy earnings guidance and the \"higher for longer\" interest rate scenario. The NYSE FANG+ index of momentum stocks closed down 2.7%. \"Today is all about the 'magnificent seven' and I don't think there's anything they could have released on the earnings front that could have satisfied folks,\" said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"So we're seeing investors take profits and a rotation out of everything that has worked this year into everything that hasn't.\" Third quarter reporting season has shifted into overdrive and is nearing its halfway point, with nearly a third of the companies in the S&P 500 slated to post results this week. At last glance, roughly four in five companies were beating earnings estimates. Analysts' most recent estimates call for aggregate year-on-year S&P 500 earnings growth of 2.6%, according to LSEG. A swath of robust data included a 4.9% quarterly annualized jump in third-quarter GDP, the strongest reading in nearly two years, feeding investor worries about restrictive Fed policy. \"Investors were \"digesting the economic data through the lens of an aggressive Federal Reserve ... it challenges the notion that the Fed will start lowering rates in 2024,\" said Greg Bassuk, Chief Executive Officer at AXS Investments in New York. \"Ironically, while the numbers are strong they exacerbate investor concerns about the Fed staying higher for longer with respect to interest rates,\" Bassuk added. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 251.63 points, or 0.76%, to 32,784.3, the S&P 500 lost 49.54 points, or 1.18%, to 4,137.23 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 225.62 points, or 1.76%, to 12,595.61. Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, communication services saw the largest percentage loss, falling 2.6%, while real estate gained the most, rising 2.2% on the session. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) beat third quarter revenue and profit expectations, but forecast 2024 spending will exceed analyst forecasts and suggested the Israel conflict could dampen fourth quarter sales. Its shares fell 3.7%.  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) lowered its revenue forecast for 2023, sending its shares down 5.9%. Chipmaker  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) slid 9.3% merger talks with Japan's Kioxia Holdings were called off.  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) jumped 4.9% following its consensus-beating quarterly report, buoyed by solid demand for its software solutions. Shares of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose in extended trading after the e-commerce giant reported better than expected quarterly revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.14-to-1 ratio favored decliners.  The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 35 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 13 new highs and 429 new lows.  Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.63 billion shares, compared with the 10.72 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.    \\n</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Stock Market Today: Dow closes lower as tech wreck continues amid Meta slump</td>\n","      <td>Investing.com</td>\n","      <td>2023-10-26 16:03:00</td>\n","      <td><a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stock-market-today-dow-closes-lower-as-tech-wreck-continues-amid-meta-slump-3210792\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stock-market-today-dow-closes-lower-as-tech-wreck-continues-amid-meta-slump-3210792</a></td>\n","      <td>Investing.com -- The Dow closed lower Thursday, pressured by a Meta-led slump in tech as concerns about slowing advertising growth offset better-than-expected quarterly results.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) fell more than 3% after it flagged weaker advertising demand seen in the fourth quarter so far. Concerns about slowing growth overshadowed Q3 results that beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines amid cost-cutting measures that boosted margin. The social media giant attributed some of the weakness to the Israel-Hamas conflict that has impacted ad-spending in the Middle East. “[W]e have observed softer ad spend in the beginning of the fourth quarter, correlating with the start of the conflict, which is captured in our Q4 revenue outlook,” the company said in its Q3 earnings call following the quarterly results on Wednesday. Other stocks including Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Pinterest Inc  (NYSE:PINS) that also rely on advertising revenue were sharply lower. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) jumped more than 5% after its Q3 results topped Wall Street estimates, underpinned by ongoing growth in its software segment as the technology company's investment into artificial intelligence appears to bearing fruit.  Revenue grew 6.3% reflecting \"the demand for hybrid cloud and AI services,\" Wedbush said in a note.  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) fell more than 5% after the shipping company trimmed its guidance following mixed third-quarter results as revenue fell short of estimates. The company said now expects full-year 2023 consolidated revenue of $91.3B to $92.3B, down from a prior estimate of $93B, as unfavorable macro-economic conditions weigh on demand.  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS), meanwhile, reported third-quarter results that missed analyst expectations and the toy maker lowered its annual revenue guidance ahead of the key holiday quarter, sending its shares more than 11% lower. “The outlook incorporates the impact of the broader Toy category declines, which is impacting the Consumer Product Segment,” Hasbro said. Treasury yields fell as signs that inflation eased more than expected in the third quarter overshadowed stronger-than-expected preliminary data showing the U.S. economy grew at its fastest quarterly pace since 2021. U.S. Treasury yields fell after the data because “markets placed greater emphasis upon a small miss by core PCE inflation and ignored a beat by Q3 GDP alongside impressive details,” Scotiabank Economics said in a note. The slew data come ahead of the core price consumer expenditure index data due Friday that is expected show inflation in the 12 months through September slowed to a 3.7% pace from 3.9% the prior month.  “We expect the Fed to recognize recent strength in economic activity but, with tightening financial conditions, to soften guidance about the need for additional tightening.

IBM  (NYSE:IBM)  (IBM) stock rose 3.8% after the tech company beat expectations on profit for the third quarter and reaffirmed its outlook.   United Parcel  (NYSE:UPS) Service (UPS) stock fell 5.4% after the delivery service cut its 2023 revenue forecast due to lower e-commerce delivery demand as it fights to win back customers lost during its difficult labor talks.

Align (NASDAQ:ALGN) stock slumped 25% after the dental company lowered its full-year revenue forecast. Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) stock fell 9.8% after the toymaker cut its annual revenue forecast for the second time, warning of choppy toy sales into the crucial holiday quarter. Merck (MRK) stock rose 2.9% after the drugmaker reported higher-than-expected third-quarter sales and profit on surprisingly strong demand for its COVID-19 treatment, primarily in Japan.

Demand across the toy industry has weakened since a pandemic surge as consumers re-allocate their budget to cover for household essentials amid rising prices and higher borrowing costs. \"Hasbro slashing its outlook and Mattel maintaining its guidance even after the blockbuster success of \"Barbie\" movie are clear signs of weakening demand,\" Insider Intelligence analyst Zak Stambor said. Hasbro cut its 2023 revenue forecast for the second time this year to a 13%-15% slide, from a prior view of a 3%-6% decline. Shares of Hasbro sank 13%, while Mattel's stock fell 10%. \"Holiday is going to be unpredictable,\" CEO Chris Cocks told Reuters, adding that the overall toy market was down around 8% to 10% going into October. CFO Gina Goetter said retailers will plan inventory cautiously, which would impact the holiday order patterns. \"The holiday demand is going to come, but it's going to be late and very deal reliant,\" Cocks said. The Monopoly maker's third-quarter revenue and profit also missed market expectations, with revenue from its core toy business dropping 18% as shoppers cut back on non-essential spending.  Its digital and licensed gaming revenue, however, grew 40% on strong demand for its \"Monopoly Go\" and \"Baldur's Gate III\" games. A day ago, rival Mattel kept its annual net sales forecast intact despite topping third quarter estimates.  Hasbro, which makes Transformers action figures, forecast its toy business to decline in mid- to high-teens for the year compared with mid-single digits decline it forecast earlier. Quarterly net revenue fell to $1.50 billion, missing estimates of $1.64 billion, according to LSEG data. Excluding certain items, it earned $1.64 per share, below expectations of $1.70.  \\n</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#####now run the function that will collect articles about multiple stocks at once.\n","#stock_news_collect_list(stock_list,pages)\n","#stock_list: a list data type containing stock names or tickers\n","#pages: the number of pages you want to collect news articles from (if pages > then the number of pages actually available, pages will be the max number instead)"],"metadata":{"id":"5JkrfE0fBs1v"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["stock_news_collect_list(['apple','EA','Tesla'],3)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"btYXgFSPCab2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1699292791752,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1108507,"user":{"displayName":"Matt Spitulnik","userId":"11314727912149081639"}},"outputId":"7c364ada-e99d-4fad-ad42-3c9e1fbc1a1e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collected the text for an article about apple.
