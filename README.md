<h1>Welcome to my Applied Data Science Portfolio.</h1>

<h2>Walkthrough</h2>
<hr>
<p>This repository contains all of my data science portfolio projects.  If you can access this, that means I have granted you access.</p>
<br>
<p>Each folder is it's own project, and all scripts, notes, and raw visualizations are contained in them.</p>
<br>
<p>Each folder contains a markdown (.md) file that outlines a general 'report' of what the project is, and will be presented in a scholarly article format (with abstract, introduction, discussion, etc.)
